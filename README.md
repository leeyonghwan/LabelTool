# Intro #
Xtreme1 is the world's first open-source platform for Multimodal training data.

Xtreme1 unlocks deep insights into data annotation, curation and ontology management for tackling machine learning challenges in computer vision and LLM. The platform's AI-fueled tools elevate your annotation game to the next level of efficiency, powering your projects in 2D/3D Object Detection, 3D Instance Segmentation and LiDAR-Camera Fusion like never before.

Today, building upon this initiative, we're delighted to present our [AI-powered Cloud platform](https://app.basic.ai/#/login/) ‚Äî **completely FREE of charge!** This groundbreaking decision marks another important step towards AI democracy, making AI solutions more accessible to everyone.

# Quick start

* Get access to [Xtreme1 online version](https://app.basic.ai/#/login/) without any installation :rocket:

* [Install and Quick start](https://docs.xtreme1.io/xtreme1-docs/get-started/quick-start) :cd:
* [Install with Docker](https://docs.xtreme1.io/xtreme1-docs/get-started/install-with-docker) üêã
* [Build Xtreme1 from source code](https://docs.xtreme1.io/xtreme1-docs/get-started/install-from-source) :wrench:

## Download package
Download the latest release package and unzip it.

```bash
wget https://github.com/xtreme1-io/xtreme1/releases/download/v0.7.1/xtreme1-v0.7.1.zip
unzip -d xtreme1-v0.7.1 xtreme1-v0.7.1.zip
```

## Start all services

```bash
docker compose up
```

Visit [http://localhost:8190](http://localhost:8190) in the browser (Google Chrome is recommended) to try out Xtreme1!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Install built-in models
You need to explicitly specify a model profile to enable model services.

```bash
docker compose --profile model up
```

## Enable model services

> Make sure you have installed [NVIDIA Driver](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/tesla-installation-notes/index.html) and [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker). But you do not need to install the CUDA Toolkit, as it already contained in the model image.

```bash
# You need set "default-runtime" as "nvidia" in /etc/docker/daemon.json and restart docker to enable NVIDIA Container Toolkit
{
  "runtimes": {
    "nvidia": {
      "path": "nvidia-container-runtime",
      "runtimeArgs": []
    }
  },
  "default-runtime": "nvidia"
}
```
